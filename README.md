<h1 align="center"> I'm Aseel Almalkawi 👋</h1>

   <h3 align="center"> I'm a beginner Data Analyst 📊, Biomedical Engineer 🧠, and storyteller at heart 🎨 based in Jordan! </h1>  
I'm trained by **Tech for Jobs – Correlation One** and certified in **Power BI** by **Shai Company**.  

I’m passionate about turning raw, messy data into clear visuals and meaningful insights — with a touch of storytelling and design. I enjoy the full data journey: from exploring datasets, cleaning, and analyzing, to building dashboards that don’t just show data… they tell a story.
